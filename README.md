PKGBUILDs
=========
A bunch of PKGBuilds I'm looking after on AUR or changed for my personal "benefit".

______
Because of the changes AUR4 will introduce following notice:
This repo will still exist, but because I didn't track .SRCINFO back then I cannot import this history into the AUR4 Repos.
So all the stuff I maintain on the AUR will be added as subtrees and main changes will be made there.

Dunno at the moment how to handle PRs.
